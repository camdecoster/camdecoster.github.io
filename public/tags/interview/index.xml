I’ve been going through some practice problems that one is likely to see during a technical interview for a developer position. One that I worked through recently has a problem statement as follows:
Write a function to reverse the order of words in a string in place.
That seems simple enough, except for the last two words, “in place.” That means that you should be mutating the existing array, not creating a new one, which is what I would initially try to do.</description>
