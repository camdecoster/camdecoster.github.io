# camdecoster.github.io

This is the personal blog for Cameron DeCoster. I use it to keep track of solutions to problems that I encounter as a Software Engineer. I occasionally add my thoughts on life, though that's usually related to something technical. This document is more to help me remember how to add to the blog than to detail instructions for anyone else. If you're not me, I hope you can learn something useful. If I'm doing something wrong/poorly, [let me know](mailto:cameron.decoster@gmail.com).
